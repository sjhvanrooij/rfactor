AURORA analyses: 
Defining the r factor for post-trauma resilience and its neural predictors 
van Rooij et al Nature Mental Health

Analyses were conducted in SPSS v.28.0

Step 1: PCA  

All 2-week and 6-month item-level clinical data from the AURORA study were imported in a long-form dataset, using the variable DATASET to indicate 2-weeks or 6-month data: DATASET=1, 6-month data; DATASET=2, 2-week data.
Available data:
- n=2772 with 2-week or 6-month item level data
- n=2062 with 6-month item-level data
- n=1835 with complete 6-month item-level data --> used for PCA

Step 2: Static and dynamic factors 

The resulting principal components (Eigenvalues >2) for dataset 1 (FAC1_6m; FAC2_6m; FAC3_6m) and dataset 2 (FAC1_2w; FAC2_2w; FAC3_2w) were exported to a wide-form dataset. The scores were multiplied by minus one to calculate static resilience scores for the r-factor, reminder acceptance, and behavioral control. Then dynamic resilience was calculated by subtracting the 2-week scores from the 6-month scores. 

Syntax:
COMPUTE rfactor_static=FAC1_6m *  - 1.
COMPUTE reminderacceptance_static=FAC2_6m *  - 1.
COMPUTE behavioralcontrol_static=FAC3_6m *  - 1.
EXECUTE.

COMPUTE rfactor_dynamic=rfactor_static - FAC1_2w.
COMPUTE reminderacceptance_dynamic= reminderacceptance_static – FAC2_2w.
COMPUTE behavioralcontrol_dynamic= behavioralcontrol_static – FAC3_2w.
EXECUTE.

Step 3: Demographics 

Neuroimaging data [Contrast estimates for the three task paradigms for regions of interest (n=9)] were extracted, exported to SPSS and merged with the dataset. 

Available data:
- n=2772 – total sample r-factor analyses --> n=1835 in analyses
- n=388 – total sample imaging (n=329 for inhibition, n=370 for threat processing, and n=325 for reward processing). Of these individuals with neuroimaging data, r-factor scores were available for total N=260 (n=215 for inhibition, n=249 for threat processing, and n=214 for reward processing). --> n=260 in analyses

A variable was created for imaging data available yes/no. The demographics table for all participants with available data were included, separately for the complete (n=1835) and neuroimaging (n=260) dataset.

Step 4: Exploring resilience scores

a. Analyses were performed investigating the associations between the resilience scores and biological sex, age, childhood trauma levels and trait resilience.

b. The 2-week and 6-month scores were compared.

c. Resilience scores were compared between individuals in the imaging sample (n=260) and individuals not included in the imaging analyses (n=1575).

Step 5: ROI analyses 

Outliers per task who deviated >3SD from the mean were excluded (Go/NoGo task, n=2, faces task, n=9, card task, n=2).
